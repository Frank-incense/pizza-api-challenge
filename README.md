# Pizza API Challenge
## Introduction

MY task was to build a RESTful API for a Pizza Restaurant using flask. I am expected to implement models validations and routes. The API will be tested using Postman. 

## Setup
1. Fork and clone the github repository to your local environment.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<Your-username>/pizza-api-challenge.git
    ```
2. Change directory to the cloned repo and initialise a virtual environment.
    ```
    cd pizza-api-challenge
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install project dependencies.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
4. Run the application.
    ```
    python server/app.py
    ```
